# AQXION™ · Content Blocks (English-first)

## HERO
We turn untransferred legacies into perpetual assets.  
Private holding. No dilution. No improvisation.

## MANIFESTO (90 words)
Every year, Latin America loses thousands of profitable family businesses.  
AQXION exists to acquire them — preserving their legacy, unlocking cash flow, and consolidating them into a disciplined holding.  
We start where venture funds don’t dare and startups can’t reach.  
First target: funeral services — profitable, fragmented, and ignored.  
We are not founders. We are operators.  
If you’re ready to retire with dignity, invest in real flow, or contribute strategic expertise — the door is open.

Succession chaos won’t be fixed by ideas.  
It will be solved by disciplined acquisition.  
AQXION has already begun. You choose where to stand.
