## Manifesto (90 words)
Peru is quietly losing its most valuable companies. Profitable family businesses vanish when owners retire without a successor. Funds ignore them, startups do not speak their language, governments look away. AQXION was built to reverse that destruction. We acquire, accelerate and consolidate overlooked assets—beginning with the funeral industry—through discipline, structure and respect. If legacy matters to you, this is your moment.

## AQXION LOOP™ tagline
Acquire → Accelerate → Consolidate

## What we do (bullet)
* Identify owner‑operated companies without succession.
* Negotiate respectful, flexible exits.
* Inject minimal technology and operational rigour.
* Integrate into a single, audited holding.
